# CryptographyCA
Implement an application applying concepts of cryptography. We did this using Java


This Github contains 3 different files labeled as different versions.
In version 0.1 you'll find  basic GUI for a secure login page and a text encryption application
in version 2.0 you'll find image encryption added to the application.
In the final version you'll find an updated GUI to finish off the application.
